# Concetti Contracting
And what does it mean to be a contractor? Well, [Concetti Contracting](https://concetticontracting.com/) is one of the most popular forms of self-employment. In the absence of an official contracting definition, a contractor is widely regarded as a one-person business who provides services to clients via their own limited company on a temporary basis.
